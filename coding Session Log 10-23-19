Hi, I have made some changes to
the code. Let me pull it from
github. is it ok ?

Yes, just let me close the old versions
first. ok!

cool ! I will pull it now

Did you change asynch_3d after
yesterday?

No, but it wasn't saved when I just 
closed it. So you may not have
pushed the most recent version

I think I have got all the changes
it might be very slight change
I have made a lot of changes
to asynch_3d . I am ignoring it now

Lets try to run the code, to see
if it works. Do you have to do
something for the interface?

It should already be up and running, but
it is not connected to the robot
at the moment, so sensor values
will likely output 0.

Thats fine, lets run the code
and see if there are no errors
and we can see if we are atleast
getting 0 using print statements
is it ok ?

Yes. I will pull up the files.
Is this the file that is need to
run?

yes it is. I will run the command noe

We are getting an error in the
act phase. the corresponding
file would be asynch_3d.py

Try running again. I believe
it was a spelling error.

sure !

It seems as though it is not being
initalized correctlly. Give me
 a few to find out why

sure. try to initialize a variable
before the import statements
and check. Just a suggestion.
Let me know when you figure it out

ok. I will text.

Shall I run the code?

I just ran it. It has completed
planing phase

inorder for the dive action to 
complete, the predicate should
be at_bottom from the
percieve phase


that is something we can manufacture
I think we can do it by putting
a fake depth or I can set the 
program up to tell us we are ate bottom
for testing purposes.

Sure ! before that let me run
a cycle to see if everything in
working fine

There is an error, let me look
at that. can you open planning.py

Hi, its hard to edit from here
as of now this will work, but
I will modify this today
and push it to github. I will
try to run it again. 

Let me push the code and I will work 
on it and let you know in 15 min

ok. I have to attend a meeting at 1
and won't be free again until 4.

oh ! I should teach a class 
from 3:30 to 4:50 pm. I will
push and pull the code 
if you have time please run the
code. else we can meet again
tomorrow. does it sound good?

Yes, I will run and send you a screen 
shot of the output if any error comes
up that I can't fix.

sure !
