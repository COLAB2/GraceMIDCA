Hi, lets run the experiment with the
grace

Hi. Let's just run in to make sure everything
flows properly without robot. I edited the code so
 that it will find bottom depth even is
at the surface.

These are actions right ! First the 
grace should start on surface. Later
when it dives it should be at bottom
can you make those actions execute in
real time?

Yes, but currently, the robot will need
to go in water to do it. I can fake the
measurement to the robot, but I would like
to make sure everything is correct and
that the programs runs by itself once we
give it a goal before we test on the actual
robot.

Perfect.

Right now it should execute the sensedepth
action. Inorder for it to know it completed
the action, it should percieve a 
state (knows(grace, pooldepth). can you
fake this in percieve?

This one doesn't need to be faked. The
robot always has access to the depth.
Also as clarification, the pooldepth state
is just atBottom or at Surface correct?

I think last time we agreed that, the
pooldepth is when the fish is not at_surface
and bottom right?

Yes, but I edited the condition of not
at surface out so that it will still say it is
at bottom after a period of time for the
purposes of testing the code.

Just a minute. 2 minutes I will
execute the action. can you open asynch.py?

Yes. I think that is because of the editor.
You have to use all spaces and not tabs.

got you.
Now it should execute raise action, 
can it get at_surface now ?

Yes. It should be able to.

it still has at_bottom.

ok ets check out the percieve code. This
should fix it..

The fish should either start at surface
or at bottom during the start of experiment.

ok. I will connect to robot to feed in
spoffed depth manually. have to turn of raspberry pi
to do it.

sure.

Will text you when it is back up.
